  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease,
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
      or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
      become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
      (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around
      1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
      difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
      serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
      medical attention.
  utter_corona_air_spread:
  - text: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted
      through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
  utter_corona_medicine:
  - text: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can
      prevent or cure the disease. We does not recommend self-medication with any
      medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
      there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
      medicines.
  utter_corona_incubation:
  - text: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning
      to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for
      COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates
      will be updated as more data become available.
